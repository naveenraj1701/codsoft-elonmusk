        <h3>Business magnet and investor</h3>
        <p id="para">
            Elon Musk is a South African-born American entrepreneur and businessman who founded X.com in 1999 (which
            later became PayPal), SpaceX in 2002 and Tesla Motors in 2003. Musk became a multimillionaire in his late
            20s when he sold his start-up company, Zip2, to a division of Compaq Computers. He has an estimated
            net-worth of around 59.2 billion dollars and is listed as the 16th richest person in the world according to
            Forbes. His ultimate goal is to make life multiplanentary and help humanity explore beyond Earth.Musk was
            born in Pretoria, South Africa, and briefly attended the University of Pretoria before immigrating to Canada
            at age 18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he matriculated at
            Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. Musk later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, and
            received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics there. He moved to California in 1995 to attend
            Stanford University. However, Musk dropped out after two days and, with his brother Kimbal, co-founded
            online city guide software company Zip2. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999, and
            with $12 million of the money he made, that same year Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com merged
            with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal.
